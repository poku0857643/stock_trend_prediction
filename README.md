# Strategy Generation and Feedback System
This system is designed to generate strategies using machine learning models and collect feedback on those strategies. It includes a FastAPI gateway that serves as the main entry point for the frontend, which interacts with various components of the system.
# Architecture Overview
The architecture consists of a FastAPI gateway that routes requests to different components, including a strategy generation service, a feedback logging service, and a monitoring agent. The system also includes an ML inference engine for generating strategies and a feedback database for storing user feedback. Monitoring is handled through Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.
# Strategy Generation and Feedback system
# FastAPI Gateway
The FastAPI gateway serves as the main entry point for the frontend, handling requests for generating strategies and submitting feedback. It routes requests to the appropriate services and manages the overall flow of data within the system.
# Strategy Generation Service
This service is responsible for generating new strategies using machine learning models. It interacts with the ML inference engine to produce strategies based on input data.
# Feedback Logging Service
The feedback logging service collects user feedback on generated strategies and stores it in a feedback database for further analysis and improvement of the strategy generation process.
# Monitoring Agent
The monitoring agent tracks system performance and health, providing insights into the operation of the strategy generation and feedback system. It integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization.

# ML Inference Engine
The ML inference engine is responsible for executing machine learning models to generate strategies. It processes input data and produces output strategies that can be used by the feedback logging service and other components of the system.
# Feedback Database
The feedback database stores user feedback on generated strategies, allowing for analysis and improvement of the strategy generation process. It provides endpoints for retrieving feedback related to specific strategies.
# Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring
Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring the system's performance and health. They provide real-time metrics and visualizations of the system's operation, allowing for proactive management and troubleshooting.
# Strategy DB
The strategy database stores all generated strategies, including their metadata, logs, outputs, and results. It provides endpoints for retrieving specific strategies and their associated data.
